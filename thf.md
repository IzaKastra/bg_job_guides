== Thief[[Thief|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

Centovente (TP Bonus +1000) was included for all sets, but you should ensure you have the accuracy to maintain capped hit rate in your TP set with it equipped.

[[:Air Knife]] was excluded from these sets.
