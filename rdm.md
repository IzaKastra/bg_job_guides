== Red Mage[[Red Mage|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

Thibron (TP Bonus +1000) was allowed for these sets since RDM gets access to Distract III.

RDM sets used Dia3 instead of Dia2, always had Composure, Temper II, and Distract III enabled.

Casting sets all used Tropical Crepe with Crooked 10-Wizard's roll and 9-Warlocks roll with job bonuses enabled.
