== Red Mage[[Red Mage|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

Thibron (TP Bonus +1000) was allowed for these sets since RDM gets access to Distract III.

[[Flametongue]], [[Ice Brand]], and [[Wizard's Rod]] were not included. However, Flametongue was the clear winner in the off-hand for nearly all physical weapon skill, even beating Naegling for main-hand Savage Blade at high buffs (assuming 15 buffs for Naegling's attack+%).

RDM sets used Dia3 instead of Dia2 and always had Composure, Temper II, Distract III, and Gain-STR enabled.

Casting sets all used Tropical Crepe with Crooked 10-Wizard's roll and 9-Warlocks roll with job bonuses enabled.
