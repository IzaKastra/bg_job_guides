== Dancer[[Dancer|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

Centovente (TP Bonus +1000) was excluded from these sets. It will likely be the strongest off-hand option for all "Damage Varies with TP" weapon skills when you have the accuracy for it, though.
