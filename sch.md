== Scholar[[Scholar|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

All sets used:
* Crooked 10-Wizard's roll and 9-Warlocks roll with job bonuses enabled
* Indi-Acumen and 20% potency BoG Geo-Malaise.
* Tropical Crepe
* Klimaform
* Storm II

Ebullience was only enabled for Kaustra and helix spells.

Prime staff ([[Opashoro]]) was not tested due to missing information about it's aftermath bonuses.

[[Wizard's Rod]] was not tested for Scholar sets.
