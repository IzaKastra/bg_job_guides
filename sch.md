== Scholar[[Scholar|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

All sets used Crooked 10-Wizard's roll, 9-Warlocks roll with job bonuses enabled, and a Tropical Crepe.

Storm II spell and Klimaform were enabled on all sets. Ebullience was only enabled for Kaustra.
