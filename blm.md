== Black Mage[[Black Mage|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.


All magic damage sets sets used:
* Crooked 10-Wizard's roll and 9-Warlocks roll with job bonuses enabled
* Indi-Acumen and 20% potency BoG Geo-Malaise.
* Tropical Crepe

Weather was disabled for these tests.

Melee sets used Grape Daifuku with standard Melee buffs defined on the main page, but against an i132 Apex enemy with 1150 evasion, 1250 defense, and 270 VIT.


The prime staff ([[Opashoro]]) was not tested due to missing information on its aftermath effect.

[[Wizard's Rod]] was not tested.
