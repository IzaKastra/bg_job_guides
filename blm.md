== Black Mage[[Black Mage|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

Black Mage sets were compared against an enemy with 1300 Evasion and 1450 Defense. Additionally, the melee sets used Sublime Sushi while the casting sets used Tropical Crepe.

Casting sets used Crooked 10-Wizard's roll and 9-Warlocks roll with job bonuses enabled.
