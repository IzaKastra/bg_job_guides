== Blue Mage[[Blue Mage|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

Thibron (TP Bonus +1000) was enabled for all sets. However, [[Ice Brand]] and [[Flametongue]] were disabled unless otherwise specified.

To determine BLU traits, I used the spell list labeled "Zahak Reborn" from the [https://www.ffxiah.com/forum/topic/30626/the-beast-within-a-guide-to-blue-mage/ FFXIAH BLU guide]. The code uses the following bonuses from this spell set:

    * Accuracy and Ranged Accuracy +48
    * Magic Accuracy +36
    * Triple Attack +5%
    * Critical hit damage +11%
    * Skillchain Bonus +16% (not used by the code)
    * Store TP +30
    * Dual Wield +25
    * STR +11
    * DEX +37
    * VIT +15
    * AGI +8
    * INT +6
    * MND +3
    * CHR +4
