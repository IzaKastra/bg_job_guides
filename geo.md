== Geomancer[[Geomancer|*]] Sets ==

See the main [[:All Jobs Gear Sets]] page for details on how each set was determined.

Most Odyssey equipment assumes Rank 30. Nyame alone assumes Rank 25 Path B.

Geomancer melee sets used Sublime Sushi instead of Grape Daifuku.

Casting sets used Crooked 10-Wizard's roll, 9-Warlocks roll with job bonuses enabled, and a Tropical Crepe.

Casting sets enabled Indi-Acumen and Geo-Malaise (BoG) at 20% Geo- potency.

Orpheus's Sash, Hachirin-no-Obi, and Wizard's Rod were disabled.
